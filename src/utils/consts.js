"Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet or you gonna freak out and start worshipping us?",
"Don’t get drawn into the culture, Morty. Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing.",
"Don’t do it guys! The casualties would be in the brazillions. Cause you’re Brazilian? It’s a threat and a pun! Nobody gets me.",
"Ruben’s seen some rough years, Morty. You don’t agree to get a theme park built inside you if your life is going great.",
"Can somebody just let me out of here? If I die in a cage, I lose a bet.",
"Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it? Rhetorical question. The answer’s yes, you just have to be a genius.",
"What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is, don’t think about it.",
"Lemme check my list of powers and weaknesses: ability to do anything, but only whenever I want.",
"There’s a lesson here and I’m not going to be the one to figure it out.",
"Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here’s something that’s never happened before: I’m a pickle! I’m Pickle Rick!",
"There’s pros and cons to every alternate timeline. Fun facts about this one: It’s got giant, telepathic spiders, eleven 9/11s, and the best ice cream in the multiverse!",
"Sometimes science is a lot more art than science. A lot of people don’t get that.",
"I’m not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe?",
"And that’s the wa-a-a-ay the news goes!",
"Morty, you gotta flip ’em off. I told them it means “peace among worlds.” How hilarious is that!",
"The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We’re the only friends we’ve got, Morty! It’s just Rick and Morty."];
